# linuxphoneapps.org

Working draft for a [Zola](https://getzola.org)-based (likely with the [adidoks](https://www.getzola.org/themes/adidoks/) theme) replacement for [LINMOBapps.frama.io](https://linmobapps.frama.io) - the goal is an app directory for Linux Phones like the PinePhone and Librem 5, which 
* performs well on these phones (linmobapps does not),
* allows for easier contributions for developers and users,
* provides more information and requires less maintenance.
