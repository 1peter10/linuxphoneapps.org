notice = "No release yet, but works for simple, encrypted text conversations. Sending attachments (images etc.) is not implemented yet, received images aren't scaling properly. Adding an account works via importing a backup or an add account screen. Compiling the necessary libdeltachat library takes a long time and requires more than 3GBs of RAM (at 4 threads) - doing this on device (PinePhone, Librem 5) is not recommended."
