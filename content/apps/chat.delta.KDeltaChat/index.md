notice = "No release yet, but works for simple, encrypted text conversations. Sending attachments (images etc.) is not implemented yet, received images aren't being displayed in a usable form. Adding an account works via importing a backup, the regular add account screen does not scroll and is thus unusable on a phone at the time of testing. Compiling the necessary libdeltachat library takes a long time and requires more than 3GB's of RAM - doing this on device is not recommended."
