MauiKit is a "a free and modular front-end framework for developing user experiences" based on [Kirigami](../kirigami).

* [MauiKit.org](https://mauikit.org/)

If you are using Plasma Mobile, but can't find an app for your use case here, make sure to check [QtQuick](../qtquick) first, as regular QtQuick apps should work great on Plasma Mobile, too.
